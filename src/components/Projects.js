          <p>
            Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game from the 80â€™s. Try to get your personal high score by moving each of the 5 randomly selected Tetromino shapes sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. For each line you will receive 10 points.
            Main functions: the game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board. The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis. If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place. Render a grid-based game in the browser.

          <p>
            A small application to keep notes. Made with SQL, Node JS and React. It is designed to practice basic Backend concepts with Node JS and SQL.
            Node JS is used to create static server, create communication with the database through endpoints (read, save, delete notes).
            SQL is used to create the database where the notes written in the app will be saved. At the moment you can only add title and description.
            React is used to create application functions with events (API requests to paint previously saved notes, save notes, delete notes, save form input values...).

          <p>
            The project consists of developing the game "Rock, Paper and Scissors". In the game both players have to choose rock, paper or scissors. It only has two possible outcomes: a tie or a win for a player and a loss for the other player. We will design the game using JavaScript where a player will play against the computer. The program generates a random movement between paper, rock and scissors (the indications to generate the random motion are later). Later the user plays, the program compares the moves and decides if the user has won, lost or tied against the computer. Also in turn the program is counting the number of points of the player and the computer. The game restarts when do 10 moves. Add a graphic representation for the scoreboard that is updated according to the plays, with total rounds, ties, cpu points and player points. Made with Highcharts.

            The project consist of laying out a web page from scratch with a
            given design in Zeplin. It is done with HTML and SCSS. The layout
            begins by modules (header, main, footer) divided into sections. Each
            section is laid out using different CSS properties (Flexbox,
            Grid...). More information in the repository readme.
