<div align="center"> <img src="/src/images/portPreview.png" width="400px"</img> </div>

✴️ Made with React.

## Description

The content is divided into different components accessible through routes. It is designed with HTML and SCSS. We have different components:

- App (main content that manages the routes to access the rest of the content).
- Landing (main page of the project).
- About me (page with brief description).
- Technologies (detail of the skills learned so far).
- Contact (with contact information).
- Projects (links to most recent projects and their description).

Each component has its associated SCSS file. 

🥳 Enjoy! 🥳 

## Pending tasks 👀

2. Cleanup of unused or repeated code.
