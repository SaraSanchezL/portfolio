# Portfolio 🌠

<div align="center"> <img src="/src/images/portPreview.png" width="400px"</img> </div>

✴️ Made with React.
This is my personal portfolio! It includes a brief description about me, all the projects done so far, skills and contact forms. 🙂 

## Description

The content is divided into different components accessible through routes. It is designed with HTML and SCSS. We have different components:

- App (main content that manages the routes to access the rest of the content).
- Landing (main page of the project).
- About me (page with brief description).
- Technologies (detail of the skills learned so far).
- Contact (with contact information).
- Projects (links to most recent projects and their description).

Each component has its associated SCSS file.

🥳 Enjoy! 🥳
