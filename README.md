# Personal Portfolio

<div align="center"> <img src="/src/images/portPreview.png" width="400px"</img> </div>

Made with React.

The content is divided into different components accessible through routes. It is designed with HTML and SCSS. We have different components:

- App (main content that manages the routes to access the rest of the content).
- Landing (main page of the project).
- About me (page with brief description).
- Technologies (detail of the skills learned so far).
- Contact (with contact information).
- Projects (links to most recent projects and their description).

Each component has its associated SCSS file.

### Tareas pendientes

1. Readjust CSS class names, to use BEM.
2. Cleanup of unused or repeated code.
3. Refactor and indent.
